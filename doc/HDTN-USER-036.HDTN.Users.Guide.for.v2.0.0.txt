PREFACE
Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) is developing new communications technologies to
increase the amount of science data returned on future space missions. The High-Rate Delay Tolerant
Networking (HDTN) project at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) will provide reliable
internetworking as a high-speed path for moving data between spacecraft payloads, and across
communication systems that operate on a range of different rates.
This document provides the user information regarding how to set up the configuration file(s) and contact
plan(s) to initialize and/or use the HDTN architecture. It also provides the external communication lanes
to connect HDTN’s component(s) to customized or external applications.
The following government contributors aided in this document: Stephanie Booth, Rachel Dudukovich,

Initial Release of User Guide for v1.0.0
Fixed
- All “volatile” variables, especially “volatile
bool”, have been replaced with “std::atomic”
with proper memory-ordering semantics.
- All convergence layer telemetry
variables/counters use “std::atomic” with
proper memory-ordering semantics.
- Routing library now uses reloaded contact
plans from the telemetry API.
- Fixed bug where router link state information
would become out of sync with actual link
state.
- Addressed minor custody transfer bug that
was found during testing.
Added
- Bundle Protocol security (BPSec) support. “bpsec-config-file” command-line argument
was added to bpgen, bpsink, bpsendfile,
bpreceivefile, and hdtn-one-process. This
argument is used to specify BPSec config file
location.
- Added “slip_over_uart” convergence layer,
allowing bidirectional communication and
framing of bundles over a COM/Serial port.
- Added “-cla-rate” command-line argument to
bpgen. This argument, defaulting to zero for
unlimited, can be used to set the rate for LTP
and UDP connections.
- Added config option
“neighborDepletedStorageDelaySeconds”
allowing for optional rerouting around
neighboring nodes with depleted storage.
Zero disables; otherwise, the value is
interpreted as the amount of time to wait
before forwarding to the neighbor after a
depleted storage message is received.
Requires that custody be enabled.
- Added functionality to support API calls for
retrieving configuration and statistics
information of HDTN (refer to Section 8.0)

Title: HDTN User Guide for V2.0.0

Added FPrime support by adding
BpSendPacket and BpReceivePacket tools
which can convert Fprime data to bundles
and vice versa.
Changed
- All bundle data types use
“padded_vector_uint8_t” instead of
“std::vector<uint8_t >” to remain uniform
across both inducts, outducts, and
BundleView. This results in API changes for:
 “LtpClientServiceDataToSend”
 the outduct “Forward” calls
 the internal buffers of “BundleViewV6” and
“BundleViewV7”
- Added support for “BundleViewV6” and
“BundleViewV7” to recycle their canonical
block header objects whenever the bundle
view object is reused in the creation or
loading of bundles.
- Combined router and scheduler into one
module.
- Updated routing logic. Minor bug fixes and
improved handling of interrupted/failed
contacts. Upon a failed contact, HDTN will
attempt to calculate a new route avoiding the
failed node.
- Changed “-bundle-rate” argument to floating
point type to allow for rates slower than one
bundle-per- second.
- Enabling BP version 6 style priority is
optional in BP version 7.
Removed
- Removed “finalDestinationEidUris”,
“udpRateBps”, and
“ltpMaxSendRateBitsPerSecOrZeroToDisable” fields from the HDTN configuration.
These values now come from the contact
plan or command- line arguments.
Fixed
- BpSourcePattern can now receive noncustody-signal bundles for outduct
convergence layers SlipOverUart and
BpOverEncap.
- Fixed BundleViews v6 and v7 bug when
using a mixture of both payload admin
records and payload non-admin records.
- Building HDTN as shared libraries now
works on all platforms.

HDTN now cleanly exits when an LTP
outduct or induct has a bad hostname. Stcp,
TcpclV3, and TcpclV4 inducts would cause a
“use after free” event when deleting a closed
connection.
UdpBatchSender now works on Apple using
a syscall to sendmsg x (the sendmmsg
equivalent).
Windows now builds with warning level 4
(previously level 3) and treats all compiler
warnings as errors; fixed all level 4 warnings.
Linux now builds with all warnings (-Wall, Wextra, -Wpedantic); fixed all warnings.
Only the CI/CD pipeline enables “Treat
warnings as Errors” (-Werror option).
Fix LTP RedPartReceptionCallback where
the isEndOfBlock parameter now reports if
the EOB came from the red data (correct
behavior) instead of whether the last segment
received from any part of the red data was
the EOB (previous incorrect behavior).
Fix LTP GreenPartSegmentArrivalCallback
where the offsetStartOfBlock parameter
incorrectly had the length of the block added
to it.
Fix BPSec decoding mishandles larger
parameter and result sizes (caused by the
wrong type cast).

Added
- New supported native platforms (g++ or
Clang).
 macOS Apple Silicon M2 on Ventura (using
ARM CPU NEON instructions)
 macOS Intel x64 on Ventura
 FreeBSD Intel x64
 OpenBSD Intel x64
 Linux ARM64 (aarch64) (using ARM CPU
NEON instructions)
- HDTN now prints the Git commit hash (from
which it was built) to the logs at initialization
(in addition to the HDTN version).
- Added the option to build the web interface
with CivetWeb (statically linked without
SSL support) instead of Boost Beast (default)
in order to reduce HDTN binary file size. See
the README for instructions.
- Added experimental
“bp_over_encap_local_stream” and
“ltp_over_encap_local_stream” convergence
layers, allowing HDTN to generate CCSDS

encap packets over a cross-platform local
stream. On Windows, this is accomplished
using a full-duplex named pipe. On
Linux/POSIX, this is accomplished using a
local AF_UNIX duplex socket.
- Added EncapRepeater.cpp demo application
to serve as an example for writing code to
intercept/extract CCSDS Encap packets from
HDTN.
- Add enforceBundlePriority config option;
setting this enforces strict priority ordering of
forwarded bundles. When true, HDTN will
forward bundles by priority. This will have a
performance impact, as it requires passing all
bundles through storage.
Changed
- HDTN config now has mandatory boolean
field enforceBundlePriority (default to false).
- Egress now disables LTP ping during times
when the contact plan DOES NOT allow
transmission. Likewise, Egress will reenable
LTP ping (back to its config file value)
during times when the contact plan allows
transmission.
- UdpBatchSender no longer has its own
thread and io_service due to now being
completely asynchronous on all platforms;
user provides an io_service to its constructor.
The LtpEngine io_service is what runs the
UdpBatchSender when using LTP over UDP
when
ltpMaxUdpPacketsToSendPerSystemCall
config variable is greater than 1.
- Windows now builds with warning level 4
(previously level 3) and treats all compiler
warnings and linker warnings as errors.
- Linux now builds with all warnings (-Wall, Wextra, -Wpedantic).
Fixed
- Fixed a race condition in egress that caused
dropped bundles. Handle the error where no
outduct exists for a bundle in egress. Egress
now returns that bundle to its sender. This
condition is careful not to mark the link
down in storage or ingress.
- Fixed missing function calls in the router to
recompute routes when using the link up and
link down API calls.

HDTN Version 1.3.0 is a minor release with several
features promoted out of the HDTN development
branch to the master branch. The most notable
additions are a new application to support multimedia
streaming over Real-time Transport Protocol and a
new configuration file editor has been added to the
HDTN web interface. The HDTN user guide for
version 1.3.0 includes updates for version 1.2.0. A
user guide specific to version 1.2.0 was not released
due to the short time span between the release of
HDTN version 1.1.0, 1.2.0, and 1.3.0. At the time of
the HDTN v1.3.0 minor release, the software and
engineering processes are undergoing improvements
to reach NASA Procedural Requirements 7150.2D
Class B compliance. HDTN is currently Class D. Full
Class B compliance is planned for HDTN v2.0.0 in
the second half of 2024. New features added to the
master branch are considered stable, however
additional testing will be conducted prior to the
release of HDTN v2.0.0.
Fixed
- Fixed a re-route issue related to the API
command for updating a link up/down and
link state.
Added
- Added support for multimedia streaming
over HDTN.
Changed
- Ported LaTeX User Guide to Word Format.
- Changed to CM templated for HDTN.
- Changed sentence “At the same time, HDTN
defines a new internal messaging format
better suited to higher-rate operation.” In
section 1.0 to “At the same time, HDTN
defines a new data format better suited to
higher-rate operation.”.
- Summarized supported convergence layers
under Convergence Layers and Routing
Protocols
- Section BP verbiage in Section 20.2.
- Figure numbering.
- Moved all authors to the TM title page and
preface of document.
- Added to section 5.4.2.
- Chapter 13 introduction section was clarified.

1.0 HIGH-RATE DELAY TOLERANT NETWORKING OVERVIEW
The High-Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN) project stems from Delay Tolerant Networking
(DTN) but takes advantage of modern hardware platforms to substantially reduce latency and improve
throughput. This enables the core actions of DTN (i.e. store, carry, and forward) on disparate links by
utilizing the DTN’s Bundle Protocol (BP). HDTN is able to achieve an efficient DTN structure by its
massively parallel pipelined and message-oriented architecture, allowing the system to scale gracefully as
its resources increase. For questions and comments on this project, feel free to reach out to the
contributors found on the Github page at https://github.com/nasa/HDTN.

3.0 ARCHITECTURE
HDTN is written in C++. The architecture is designed to be modular and, therefore, the groupings of each
modular piece are called modules. These modules include:
x Ingress - Processes incoming bundles.
x Storage - Stores bundles to disk.
x Router - Calculates routes for bundles and determines when bundles may be forwarded.
x Egress - Forwards bundles to the proper outduct and next hop.
x Telemetry Command Interface - Displays the operations and data for HDTN.
x Libraries - implement common algorithms and functions needed by the HDTN core modules such
as Routing and BPSec libraries
Figure 3-1 shows the HDTN modules and their interactions:

5.2

All of HDTN’s modules/libraries contain their own CMakeLists.txt file.
The root CMakeLists.txt file adds all modules/libraries to the HDTN project using the CMake
add_subdirectory command.
Package config information is exported to the installation directory (install
root/lib/cmake) when a “make install” is performed.
o An example of this can be found in
tests/unit_tests_import_installation/CMakeLists.txt
Package config information is for writing custom software projects that only use portions of the
HDTN codebase such as a library of a particular convergence layer.
HDTN CMake optimizes the build
o Tests the compiler for more recent C++ standards
o Tests the compiler and the CPU for specific x86 hardware instructions and utilizes those,
if available
o For operational usage, the CMake “Release mode” is recommended.
o For troubleshooting, the CMake “Debug mode” is covered in Section 19.0.
HDTN CMake supports building its libraries as either static or shared
o Uses CMake’s GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER
 Required for building or using .dll files on Windows
 Required for using GCC C++ visibility support

Build HDTN on Linux

The dependencies can be installed using the following command(s):
On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libzmq3-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-all-dev openssl libssl-dev
sudo apt install git-all
On RHEL/OEL
sudo dnf install epel-release
sudo yum install cmake boost-devel zeromq zeromq-devel
sudo dnf install git-all
To build HDTN in “Release mode”, perform the following steps. (Note: If the -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
is not specified, HDTN is built in “Release mode” by default).
x git clone https://github.com/nasa/HDTN.git
x export HDTN SOURCE ROOT=/home/username/HDTN (set to filepath containing
HDTN)
x cd $HDTN SOURCE ROOT
x mkdir build
x cd build
x cmake ..
x open CMakeCache.txt
– To build HDTN static
 Set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF
 CMAKE CXX FLAGS RELEASE:STRING=-03 -DNDEBUG

 CMAKE CXX FLAGS RELEASE:STRING=-03 -DNDEBUG -fPIC

make
– Adding -j8 (i.e. make -j8) to the make will speed up the processing time but requires a
system with at least 8 cores.

5.2.1 Optional x86 Hardware Acceleration
HDTN build environment sets the following CMakeCache variables to “On” by default:
USE_X86_HARDWARE_ACCELERATION and LTP_RNG_USE_RDSEED.
Notes:
x If building natively (i.e. not cross-compiling), the HDTN CMake build environment will check
the processor’s CPU instruction set and the compiler to determine which HDTN hardware
accelerated functions will build and run on the native host. CMake automatically sets various
compiler definitions to enable supported HDTN hardware accelerated features.
x If cross-compiling, the HDTN CMake build environment will check the compiler to determine if
the HDTN hardware accelerated functions will build. It is up to the user to determine if the target
processor can support/run those instructions. CMake will automatically set various compiler
definitions to enable supported HDTN hardware accelerated features only if they compile.
x Hardware accelerated functions can be turned off by setting
USE_X86_HARDWARE_ACCELERATION and/or LTP_RNG_USE_RDSEED to “Off” in the
CMakeCache.txt.
x If building for ARM or any non X86-64 platform, USE_X86_HARDWARE_ACCELERATION
and LTP_RNG_USE_RDSEED must be set to “Off”.
If CMake finds support for the CPU instructions and USE_X86_HARDWARE_ACCELERATION is turned
“On” then some or all of the following features will be enabled:
x Fast SDNV encode/decode (BPv6, TCPCLv3, and LTP) requires SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3,
SSE4.1, POPCNT, BMI1, and BMI2.
x Fast batch 32-byte SDNV decode (not yet implemented into HDTN but available in the
common/util/Sdnv library) requires AVX, AVX2, and the above “Fast SDNV” support.
x Fast CBOR encode/decode (BPv7) requires SSE and SSE2.
x Some optimized loads and stores for TCPCLv4 requires SSE and SSE2.
x Fast CRC32C (BPv7 and a storage hash function) requires SSE4.2.
x The HDTN storage controller will use BITTEST if available. If BITTEST is unavailable, it will
use ANDN if BMI1 is available.
If LTP_RNG_USE_RDSEED is turned “On”, this feature will be enabled if CMake finds support for this
CPU instruction:
x An additional randomness source for LTP’s random number generator requires RDSEED. This
feature can be disabled for potentially faster LTP performance.
5.2.2 Storage Capacity Compilation Parameters
HDTN build environment sets two CMake cache variables by default:
STORAGE_SEGMENT_ID_SIZE_BITS and STORAGE_SEGMENT_SIZE_MULTIPLE_OF_4KB.

Uncontrolled when printed. Verify that this is correct version before use.

Revision: 2.0.0
Page 20 of 69

The STORAGE_SEGMENT_ID_SIZE_BITS flag must be set to the recommended default, 32 or
64. It determines the size/type of the storage module’s segment_id_t. Setting the flag to 32bit significantly decreases memory usage because we don’t need to use the RAM.
– If this value is 32, the formula for the max segments (S) is given by
S = min(UINT32_MAX,646 §4.3 billion
segments since segment_id_t is a uint32_t. A segment allocator using 4.3 Billion
segments uses about 533 MByte RAM), and multiplying by the minimum 4KB block size
gives 17TB bundle storage capacity. Make sure to appropriately set the
totalStorageCapacityBytes variable in the HDTN JSON config so that only the
required amount of memory is used for the segment allocator.
– If this value is 64, the formula for the max segments (S) is given by
S = min(UINT64MAX,646 §68.7 billion
segments since segment id_t is a uint64_t. Using a segment allocator with 68.7 Billion
segments, when multiplying by the minimum 4KB block size gives ‫׽‬281TB bundle
storage capacity.
The flag STORAGE_SEGMENT_SIZE_MULTIPLE_OF_4KB must be set to an integer of 1 or
greater. It determines the minimum increment of bundle storage based on the standard block size
of 4096 bytes. (Note: One is the default and recommended.) Example:
– If STORAGE_SEGMENT_SIZE_MULTIPLE_OF_4KB=1 , a 4KB*1=4KB block size is
used. A bundle size of 1KB would require 4KB of storage. A bundle size of 6KB would
require 8KB of storage.
– If STORAGE_SEGMENT_SIZE_MULTIPLE_OF_4KB=2, a 4KB*2=8KB block size is
used. A bundle size of 1KB would require 8KB of storage. A bundle size of 6KB would
require 8KB of storage. A bundle size of 9KB would require 16KB of storage. If
STORAGE_SEGMENT_ID_SIZE_BITS=32
then bundle storage capacity could potentially double from ‫׽‬17TB to ‫׽‬34TB.

For information on how the Storage works, see module/storage/doc/storage.pptx in the
HDTN main repository.

PowerShell (recommended Visual Studio Code with the PowerShell extension installed)
7-Zip
Perl (needed for building OpenSSL) with perl.exe in the Path environmental variable (Strawberry
Perl for Windows has been tested)

To build HDTN and its dependencies in Release mode and as shared libraries (shared .dll files for both
HDTN and its dependencies), simply run the PowerShell script in
building_on_windows\hdtn_windows_cicd_unit_test.ps1 from any working directory.
The working directory does not matter. Once finished, HDTN and its dependencies will be installed to
C:\hdtn_build_x64_release_vs2022 (suffix will be 2019 or 2017 if that’s the Visual Studio
compiler installed). The script will also run HDTN’s unit tests after the build. Once completed, you will
see the following message:
“Remember, HDTN was built as a shared library, so you must
prepend the following to your Path so that Windows can find the
DLL’s of HDTN and its dependencies:”
It will print four directory locations to be added to your Path environmental variable to facilitate use of
HDTN outside this PowerShell script.
x From the Windows Start Menu, type env
x Open Edit environmental variables for your account
x Double click Path
x Add the four directories. (Omit the directory containing hdtn_install\lib if modifying
HDTN source code within Visual Studio. You will later build and install your HDTN binaries
within Visual Studio.)
x If you are a user of HDTN and you are NOT going to modify HDTN source code within Visual
Studio, also add this directory to your Path:
C:\hdtn_build_x64_release_vs2022\hdtn_install\bin
x Click OK
x Click New
x Add the following new variable: HDTN_SOURCE_ROOT
x Set the variable value to your source root (the folder that contains README.md).
Example C:\path\to\hdtn
x Click OK
x Click OK
If you are a user of HDTN and you are NOT going to modify HDTN source code within Visual Studio,
you can reference any of the .bat file example tests located in
HDTN_SOURCE_ROOT\tests\test_scripts_windows. Note that these scripts were intended for
developers, so you will have to modify the scripts, fixing any lines that reference HDTN_BUILD_ROOT,
so, for example, if you see %HDTN_BUILD_ROOT%\common\bpcodec\apps\bpgenasync.exe, replace it with bpgen-async.exe. Also note that these .bat files reference config files
located in HDTN_SOURCE_ROOT\config_files, so feel free to modify those .json configs to meet
your needs.

If you are a developer and you are going to modify HDTN source code within Visual Studio, you may
delete the directory C:\hdtn_build_x64_release_vs2022\hdtn_install and continue on
with the next set of instructions.
Launch Visual Studio 2022 and open HDTN as a project with these steps:
x File >> open >> cmake
x Open HDTN root CMakeLists.txt
x Make sure drop down configuration at the top is set to x64-Release. You may need to go to
Manage Configurations if not.
Then click Project >> view CMakeCache.txt Add these lines (change vs2022 directory suffix if
different):
x BOOST_INCLUDEDIR:PATH=C:\hdtn_build_x64_release_vs2022\boost_1_78
_0_install
x BOOST_LIBRARYDIR:PATH=C:\hdtn_build_x64_release_vs2022\boost_1_78

4 install\lib\libzmq-v143-mt-4_3_4.lib (note: may be v141 or v142)
x BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON
Then click Project >> configure cache
It is now time to set up additional environmental variables in order to be able to run the .bat file tests
located in HDTN_SOURCE_ROOT\tests\test_scripts_windows:
x Right click on the open tab within Visual Studio titled CMakeCache.txt and then click "Open
Containing Folder"
x Copy the path at the top of the Windows Explorer window
x From the Windows Start Menu, type "env", open "Edit environmental variables
for your account"
x Click New
x Add the following new variable: HDTN_BUILD_ROOT. The variable value will look something
like C:\Users\username\CMakeBuilds\17e7ec0d-5e2f-4956-8a91lb32467252b0\build\x64-Release
x Click OK
x Click New
x Add the following new variable: HDTN_INSTALL_ROOT; the value will look similar to
HDTN_BUILD_ROOT except change “build” to “install”.

Click OK
Double click the Path variable, add the HDTN_INSTALL_ROOT\lib folder to your Path,
something like C:\Users\username\CMakeBuilds\17e7ec0d-5e2f-4956-8a911b32467252b0\install\x64-Release\lib. This step is needed because HDTN is built
as a shared library with multiple .dll files, so this step allows Windows to find those .dll files
when running any HDTN binaries.

Relaunch Visual studio so that it gets loaded with the updated environmental variables. Now build
HDTN:
x Build >> Build All
x Build >> Install HDTN
x Run unit_tests.bat located in
HDTN_SOURCE_ROOT\tests\test_scripts_windows
x For a Web GUI example, run test_tcpcl_fast_cutthrough_oneprocess.bat and
then navigate to https://localhost:8086 (note: to exit cleanly, do a ctrl-c in each cmd window
before closing)
NOTE: Since CMake is currently configured to build HDTN as a shared library (because the CMake
cache variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is set to ON), any time you make a source code change to HDTN,
for it to be reflected in the binaries, don’t forget to Build >> Install HDTN after the
Build >> Build All step.
5.4.2

Setup Instructions for Developers Using Installed HDTN Libraries within their own
Projects
HDTN utilizes modern CMake. When HDTN is installed, it installs the appropriate CMake Packages that
can be imported. For an example of this use case, see
HDTN_SOURCE_ROOT\tests\unit_tests_import_installation\CMakeLists.txt for
a project that imports the libraries and headers from an HDTN installation and builds HDTN’s unit tests
from that installation.
All libraries can be imported as a shared or static library from a built and installed HDTN. Figure 5-1
shows the cmake script to import the LTP library.

Build HDTN on ARM

HDTN is compiled with x86 hardware optimizations by defaults. To compile for ARM, these
optimizations must be disabled. To build HDTN on ARM running Ubuntu (follow Ubuntu dependencies
in Sections 4.2 and 5.2):
1. cd HDTN
2. mkdir build && cd build
3. cmake .. -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=arm
4. make -j
5. sudo make install -j
These commands should work for any ARM platform running Ubuntu such as Raspberry Pi 4 or Nvidia
Jetson Nano. Compiling on a Raspberry Pi 4 takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. It is
recommended to compile with only one or two cores (make -j2) on memory constrained devices to
ensure gcc does not consume all RAM.

Compiling HDTN
Download the latest HDTN from Github.
Unzip the file in your home directory.
– Note: Users cannot write directly to ARM emulator directories in Windows Subsystem
for Linux.
sudo mv HDTN /var/chroot/home
sudo chroot /var/chroot
cd home/HDTN
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=arm
make -j 1
– Multiple threads will cause a race condition.
Useful Commands
readelf -h executable
– Read executable header.
apt install cmake-curses-gui
– Installs CMakeCache.txt editor install for static builds.
ccmake ..
– Runs the CMakeCache.txt editor.

6.0 RUNNING HDTN
Note: Ensure your config files (described in Section 13.0) are correct, e.g., check that the outduct
remotePort is the same as the induct boundPort, a consistent convergenceLayer, and the
outduct’s remoteHostname is pointed to the correct IP adress. tcpdump can be used to test the HDTN
ingress storage and egress. The generated pcap file can be read using wireshark: sudo tcpdump -i
lo -vv -s0 port 4558 -w hdtn-traffic.pcap
In another terminal, run: ./runscript.sh
NOTE: The Contact Plan, which lists future contacts for each node, is located under
module/router/-contact_plans/contactPlan.json and includes the source and
destination nodes, the start and end times, and the data rates. Based on the schedule in the Contact Plan
the router sends events on link availability to Ingress and Storage. When the Ingress receives the Link
Available event for a given destination, it sends the bundles directly to egress. When the Link is
Unavailable it sends the bundles to storage. Upon receiving Link Available event, Storage releases
the bundle(s) for the corresponding destination. When a Link Down event is received, Storage stops
releasing the bundles.

7.0 GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
7.1

Running the Web Interface

This repository comes equipped with code to launch a web-based user interface to display statistics for the
HDTN engine. It relies on a dependency called Boost Beast which is packaged as a header-only library
that comes with a standard Boost installation. The web interface requires OpenSSL since the web
interface supports both http as well as https, and hence both WS (WebSocket) and WSS (WebSocket
Secure). The web interface is compiled by default. Anytime that HDTNOneProcess runs, the web page
will be accessible at http://localhost:8086
To prevent the web interface from running, follow the normal build instructions for Linux. The only
difference will be in the cmake command will now be:
cmake -DUSE_WEB_INTERFACE:BOOL=OFF ..

7.2

Statistics Page

This page, displayed in Figure 7-1, displays real-time telemetry of HDTN. At the top are three boxes
displaying the current Data Rate in Mega-Bits Per Second, the Average Data Rate, and the Maximum
Data Rate reached. All of these are measured in the Ingress module.
Beneath are three graphs. The first two display the data rate of the Ingress and Egress Modules in
Mega-bits Per Second. The third graph is a pie chart displaying the location of data bundles received by
Ingress - either sent to the Storage module or directly to Egress. If a bundle is sent from Storage to Egress,
it will be measured on the pie chart as having gone to Egress.

System View Page

This page can be accessed by clicking System View GUI in the top left-hand corner of the Statistics
page. As shown in Figure 7-2, this page displays a graphic of the different modules of HDTN as well as
information on where the bundled data is coming from and where it is going. In the top row are adjustable
settings for users to make the information more legible. On the left of the page are the IP addresses and
IPN numbers from which data is being received. On the right is displayed the Nodes and IPN numbers to
which data is being sent from this HDTN node. The graphic displays the data rate as data comes into
Ingress, between the different modules of HDTN (Ingress, Storage, and Egress), and the rate as it leaves
Egress. The Storage graphic displays the percentage and amount of storage space being used.
Users can also hover over each HDTN module and a pop-up graphic will appear displaying data for that
module. An example is shown in Figure 7-3 which shows this information for the Storage module.

8.0 GETTING STARTED WITH THE API
The HDTN API is a ZeroMQ-Based Messaging API that follows a request-reply messaging pattern. The
HDTN API leverages the ZeroMQ messaging library to facilitate efficient and flexible communication
between HDTN and other software systems. It enables users to request information on the configuration
and statistics of HDTN.
A simple python script named run_api_commands.py under tests/tests_scripts_linux has been
provided as a reference. This script contains all the supported API calls. The API calls can be utilized in
any programming language that support the ZeroMQ library. The HDTN API accepts and responds with
JSON-encoded strings.

9.0 COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
A Command Line Interface (CLI) application is automatically built as part of the regular HDTN build
process. It can be found under the build/module/cli folder after compiling HDTN. It is used to
interact with the HDTN API for configuring and controlling the software.

9.1

Usage

The HDTN CLI is invoked by running the hdtn-cli command. HDTN must be running for the CLI to
work. Currently, it only supports a limited set of command options. To see the list of options, run hdtncli --help. To get started:
1. Build HDTN (see instructions in the main README.md).
2. Install HDTN (see instructions in the main README.md).
3. Run an instance of HDTN (see instructions in the main README.md).
4. Run hdtn-cli --help for a list of commands.
5. Run hdtn-cli <command1> <command2> ... to run the desired CLI commands.

10.0 SIMULATIONS
HDTN can be simulated using DtnSim, a third party, open-source simulator for delay tolerant networks
built on the OMNeT++ 1 simulation framework. Use the “support-hdtn” branch of DtnSim which can be
found in the official DtnSim repository2. HDTN simulation with DtnSim has only been tested on Linux
(Debian and Ubuntu). Follow the readme instructions for HDTN and DtnSim to install the software. More
Details about the installation steps can be found here 3.

11.0 HDTN APPLICATIONS
HDTN comes with many applications to use as isolated modules or in conjunction with HDTN. The
current set of HDTN applications are:
x BPGen – Generates bundles (is intended to be used with its receiving tool BPSink).
x BPSink – Receives and validates bundles (is intended to be used with its generating tool BPGen).
x BPSendFile – Sends a single file or a directory of files (with recursion).
x BPReceiveFile – Receives the bundles in any order, reassembles the fragments, if applicable, and
writes the file(s) to a user-specified directory.
x BPSendStream – Generates bundles from Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets.
x BPRecvStream – Receives bundles containing RTP packets and outputs the RTP packets.
x BPing – Generates ping bundles.
x BPSendPacket – Generates bundles from UDP or STCP payload data.
x BPReceivePacket – Receives bundles containing UDP or STCP payload data and outputs.
Figure 11-1 shows how these applications connect to HDTN’s modules.

12.0 RUNSCRIPT
One run script file (in JSON format) is required per each instance of HDTN. Each file starts with
assigning path variables, starting up Egress (the outduct), and the bpsink (the method of where bundles
will be received). Each file ends with starting up Ingress, assigning bpgen (the process by which bundles
can be generated), and a cleanup procedure (optional). Within each file, two different setups can be found
depending on if the setup is cut-through, i.e. by-passes Storage or utilizes Storage and, in turn, the Router.
The cut-through option requires the link to be up and no BPv6 custody. Note: To avoid starting up Egress
and Ingress separately, a method called hdtn-one-process combines the two with one command. An
example runscript can be found at HDTN/runscript.sh.

12.1 Path Variables
The Path Variables section of each run script file points to the locations of all required configuration files.
This way, one needs only to edit this section instead of each section if only changing a configuration file.
The path variables contain locations of:
x config files
x hdtn config
x bpsec config
x sink config
x gen config
The section ends with a cd $HDTN_SOURCE_ROOT an already declared variable in your Linux path.
This command is here if the run script is not in the HDTN source root directory (where HDTN runs).

12.2 BpSink
A typical instantiation of BpSink is:
./build/common/bpcodec/apps/bpsink-async --my-uri-eid=ipn:2.1 -inducts-config-file=$sink_config --bpsec-config-file=$bpsec_config &
The command has three main parts: (1) the location of the bpsink code within HDTN, (2) the endpoint ID
number, and (3) the inducts configuration file location.

Uncontrolled when printed. Verify that this is correct version before use.

Title: HDTN User Guide for V2.0.0

The ipn:2.1 shows, in this particular case, the receiving node is the second endpoint. The $sink_config
response ties to the respectable Path Variable. For more information about the sink configuration file see
section 13.2. bpsec-config-file is an optional parameter that is only required if BPSec is enabled
and bpsink node is a security acceptor. This option specifies the location of the BPSec Config file which
has the policy rules and security operation failure events handling. To end bpsink, it is recommended to
insert a 3 second pause command to initialize before the configuration file starts the next section, i.e.
sleep 3.

./build/common/bpcodec/app-s/bpreceivefile --save-directory=received -my-uri-eid=ipn:2.1 --inducts-config-file=$sink config --bpsec-configfile=$bpsec_config &
The command has 3 main parts: (1) the new directory where the received data is saved, (2) the receiving
node endpoint id, and (3) the inducts configuration file location. The $gen config response ties to the
respectable Path Variable. For more information about the gen configuration file see section 13.3.
bpsec-config-file is an optional parameter that is only required if BPSec is enabled and
bpreceivefile node is a security acceptor. This option specifies the location of the BPSec Config file
which has the policy rules and security operation failure events handling.
To end bpreceivefile, it is recommended to insert an 8 second pause command to initialize before the
configuration file starts the next section, i.e. sleep 8.

If HDTN only needs to run for a certain amount of time and then end, add a line under all other sections
(minus the path variables) after the instantiation command in the format of <SectionName >PID=$! For
example, after bpgen’s instantiation, the cleanup command will be: bpgen_PID=$!
Within the clean-up section, wait for HDTN to run. Then, from the bottom to the top of the configuration
file sections, end them via format of NLOOí3,'QDPH!. A wait statement for at least 2 seconds
between each kill command is included. Clean-up script example:
sleep 30
echo "\nkilling bpgen..." && kill -2 $bpgen_PID
sleep 2
echo "\nkilling HDTN storage..." && kill -2 $storage_PID

echo "\nkilling router..." && kill -9 $router_PID
sleep 2
echo "\nkilling egress..." && kill -2 $egress_PID
sleep 2
echo "\nkilling bpsink..." && kill -2 $bpsink_PID
This example will run HDTN for 30 seconds before closing HDTN.
The following options can be added: (1) --bpsec-config-file=$bpsec_config: if BPSec is
enabled and this HDTN node is a security source, acceptor, or verifier it’s required to add this option to
specify the BPSec Config file which has the policy rules and security operation events handling. (2) useunix-timestamp to use a contact plan with unix timestamp and (3) use-mgr to use Multigraph Routing
Algorithm instead of the default CGR Dijkstra routing Algorithm.
To end hdtn-one-process, it is recommended that users insert a 10 second pause command to initialize
before the configuration file starts the next section, i.e. sleep 10.
Note: When using the hdtn-one-process, the runscript does not need to instantiate the Egress, Storage,
Ingress, and Router separately.

autoDeleteFilesOnExit: tells HDTN, when cleanly closed, to delete or save all storage bundles
totalStorageCapacityBytes: storage module capacity or quota for bundles, in Bytes. NOTE: each
storage item in the storageDiskConfigVector must be able to hold totalStorageCapacityBytes
divided by the number items in the total storageDiskConfigVector
storageDeletionPolicy: policy for deleting expired bundles from disk. Options are “never”: never
delete expired bundles, “on expiration”: delete bundles as the expire, and “on storage full”: delete
all expired bundles when storage reaches 90% capacity.
storageDiskConfigVector is a striping scheme similar to RAID 0 but not using RAID itself.
NOTE: can have unlimited storage vector size i.e. number of storeFilePath(s).

Miscellaneous notes for the HDTN configuration file:
x Depending on the convergence layer there may be additions to the “inductVector”,
“outductVector”. See section 15.0 for details.
x Ingress, Egress, and/or storage are optional additions to the HDTN configuration file depending
on the HDTN node need.

13.2 sink_config
A typical sink configuration file includes an “inductConfigName” and an “inductVector”. The
“inductVector” requires the name, convergence layer, the bound port number, and the number of received
circular buffer elements. For details about this section, see section 13.1 since the bp sink config file is a
copy of the inductConfigName/inductVector of the hdtn config file. This is because the bp sink config file
goes to the BPSink application detailed in section 11.0. Note: Depending on the convergence layer there
may be additions to the “inductVector”. See section 15.0 for details. Structure example:
"inductsConfig": {
"inductConfigName": "myconfig",
"inductVector": [
{
"name": "stcp ingress",
"convergenceLayer": "stcp",
"boundPort": 4556,
"numRxCircularBufferElements": 200,
}
]
},

13.3 gen_config
A typical gen configuration file includes an “outductConfigName” and an “outductVector”. The
“outductVector” requires: the name, convergence layer, next hop, remote hostname, remote port, bundle
pipeline limit, and the final destination endpoint ID. For details about this section see section 13.1 since
the gen config file is a copy of the outductConfigName/outductVector of the hdtn config file. This is due
to the gen config file going to the BPGen application detailed in section 11.0 Note: depending on the
convergence layer there may be additions to the “outductVector”. See section 15.0 for details. Structure

Triggered when the contents of a security operation or the protected contents of a
target block have been modified, or an incorrect key is used to process the
operation.
 Example: A bundle is received with integrity applied to the payload block, but a
transmission error has altered the contents of the data field in that block and now
it cannot be verified.
The supported actions are:
“removeSecurityOperation”: Discard the affected BIB or BCB, but not the target block.
“removeSecurityOperationTargetBlock”: Discard the affected target block. If this is the payload
block, then the entire bundle will be discarded because a bundle must contain a payload block.

14.0 CONTACT PLANS
For an HDTN node, a single contact entry describes an availability time slot for the next hop (destination)
of one of its outducts. The entry contains begin and end times for when the next hop is accessible, as well
as the speed and one-way trip time of the link between them.
The contact plan file lists this information for all contacts of a node. If a next hop is available at different
times or with different conditions, each variation requires its own contact entry. A single contact plan may
contain entries for multiple nodes in the network. Any entry will be discarded if it doesn’t contain the
node number of the node currently processing it. If a node has an outduct with a next hop that does not
appear in the contact plan, it will never route bundles to it. This includes STCP outducts on the same host.
The contact plan is a JSON file that is only used within the HDTN bundle agent (i.e. hdtn-one-process).
Example files are available under HDTN/module/router/contact_plans/src

16.0 TEST CONFIGURATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS
16.1 TCP Loopback Test
To run this simple Loopback Test as shown in Figure 16-1, from the HDTN source directory run the
command:
./runscript.sh 6
This works by running 3 modules for about 30 seconds:
- BPGen - Generates the bundles and sends them to the Ingress module.
- HDTN One Process - Launches the modules for HDTN as a single process. Since this is a
cutthrough mode test, Storage is not used. Ingress, Egress, and Router are run.
- BPSink - Receives the bundle data from Egress.

Figure 16-1: HDTN Loopback Test.

16.2 Two Node LTP Test
This test, shown in Figure 16-2, relies on having two nodes running HDTN: the sender and the receiver.
The sender will run BPGen, and HDTN One Process. The receiver will run BPSink, and HDTN One
Process. Example scripts for this can be found under
HDTN/tests/test_scripts_linux/LTP_2Nodes_Test 7.
Separate machines with HDTN installed can each run either the sender or receiver. If using these
runscripts this way, users should update the remoteHostname field in each config file to the proper IP
addresses. The config files for these scripts can be found under
HDTN/config_files/hdtn/hdtn_Node1_ltp.json 8
and HDTN/config_files/hdtn/hdtn_Node2_ltp.json 9.
When running this test, users should start the receiver script before the sender script.

Figure 16-2: HDTN Two Nodes Test

16.3 Four Nodes STCP Test
Shown in Figure 16-3, this test relies on having four nodes running HDTN and uses the router module.
Node 1 runs BPGen and HDTN One Process. Node 2 and 3 only run HDTN One Process. The final
destination Node 4 will run HDTN One Process and BPSink.

Figure 16-3: HDTN Four Nodes STCP Routing Test

In Node 1’s HDTN config file, the next hop is configured to node 3 originally. After the router computes
the optimal route to the final destination, the outduct will select node 2 as next hop instead. At
initialization, the HDTN json config file for each node has all possible next hops. If we have multiple
hops leading to the same final destination, only one Outduct should be initialized with the final
destinations vector, and the other next hops Outducts should be dormant, ie having no values initialized in
their final destinations json fields. Router will compute the best route and send an event to Egress to
update the Outduct to use the nextHop for that optimal route leading to the final destination.
The runscripts for each node can be found under
HDTN/tests/test_scripts_linux/Routing_Test 10.
The config files for Node 1 can be found at
HDTN/config_files/hdtn/hdtn_node1_cfg.json 11 with the other node config files
immediately following it. If running on separate machines, make sure to update the remoteHostname
field in each config file to the proper IP addresses. Users should start the runscript for each node ordered
from receiver to sender, i.e start Node 4, then Nodes 3, 2, and 1.

16.4 File Transfer Test
This test relies on having two machines running HDTN: the sender and the receiver. The sender will run
BPSendFile, and HDTN One Process. The receiver will run BPReceiveFile, and HDTN One Process.
Example scripts were added to send files using LTP and TCPCL convergence layers. They can be found
under HDTN/tests/test_scripts_linux/LCRD_File_Transfer_Test 12. Both BPv6 with
and without custody transfer and BPv7 with and without BPSec are supported in this example. Figure
16-4 shows the file transfer test with BPSec enabled where the source encrypts the plaintext associated
with the payload and the destination does the security verification and decryption of the payload. Separate
machines with HDTN installed can each run either the sender or receiver. User should update the
remoteHostname field in each HDTN config file in this directory to the proper IP addresses.
When running this test, users should start the receiver script before the sender script.

16.5 Integrated Tests
A series of integrated tests 13 were added using Boost Test Framework. These tests are automatically run
as part of our CI/CD pipeline. The main tests currently included are HDTN Loopback tests in cutthrough
and storage modes (using contact plans with or without link disruptions).

17.0 GETTING STARTED WITH STREAMING VIA HDTN
Streaming over HDTN requires the use of the following two HDTN applications: BPSendStream and
BPRecvStream. An overview of BPSendStream and BPRecvStream are mentioned in section 11.0.

17.1 Configuration Parameters for BPSendStream

17.3 Runscripts for Streaming Scenarios
For the following streaming scenarios, GStreamer was used to facilitate the handling of multimedia data.
GStreamer is an open-source multimedia framework that provides a pipeline-base system for handling
multimedia data.
17.3.1 File Streaming
GStreamer was used in this scenario to convert a video file into a RTP stream and forward the stream to
BPSendStream. Example runscripts for this type of scenario can be found under the following directory:
tests\test_script_linux\Streaming\file_streaming\
17.3.2 Live Streaming
GStreamer can be used to fetch a live RTSP stream from a camera and forward the stream to
BPSendStream. Consult the GStreamer documentation to leverage this capability.

17.4 More Details

18.0 CONTAINERIZATION
HDTN currently supports the use of Docker and Kubernetes to deploy containers with HDTN built with
all required dependencies.

18.1 Docker Instructions
First make sure docker is installed.
apt-get install docker
Check the service is running.
systemctl start docker
There are currently two Dockerfiles for building HDTN, one for building an Oracle Linux container and
the other for building an Ubuntu. This command will build the Ubuntu one:
docker build -t hdtn_ubuntu_containers/docker/ubuntu/ .
The -t sets the name of the image, in this case hdtn_ubuntu. Check the image was built with the
command:
docker images
Now to run the container use the command:
docker run -d -t hdtn_ubuntu
Check that it is running with:
docker ps
To access it, you’ll need the CONTAINER_ID listed with the ps command.
docker exec -it container_id bash
Stop the container with
docker stop container_id

The same container can either be restarted or removed. To see all the containers use:
docker ps -a
These can still be restarted with the run command above. To remove one that will no longer be used:
docker rm container_id

18.2 Docker Compose Instructions
Docker compose can be used to spin-up and configure multiple nodes at the same time. This is done using
the docker compose file found under HDTN/containers/docker/docker_compose.
cd containers/docker/docker_compose
This file contains instructions to spin up two containers using Oracle Linux. One is called hdtn_sender
and the other hdtn_receiver. Start them with the following command:
docker compose up
On another bash terminal these can be accessed using the command:
docker exec -it hdtn_sender bash
docker exec -it hdtn_receiver bash
This setup is perfect for running a test between two hdtn nodes. An example script for each node can be
found under HDTN/tests/test_scripts_linux/LTP_2Nodes_Test/. Be sure to run the receiver script first,
otherwise the sender will have nowhere to send to at launch.

18.3 Kubernetes Instructions
Download the dependencies
sudo apt-install docker microk8s
The first step is to create a docker image to be pushed locally for kubernetes to pull:
docker build docker/ubuntu/. -t myhdtn:local
Check that it was built:
docker images
Next we build the image locally and inject it into the microk8s image cache
docker save myhdtn > myhdtn.tar
microk8s ctr image import myhdtn.tar
Confirm this with:
microk8s ctr images ls
Now we deploy the cluster, the yaml must reference the injected image name:
microk8s kubectl apply -f
containers/kubernetes/hdtn_10_node_cluster.yaml
There should now be ten kubernetes pods running with HDTN. See them with:
microk8s kubectl get pods
To access a container in a pod, enter the following command:
microk8s kubectl exec -it container name -- bash

When you’re finished working with this deployment, delete it using:
microk8s kubectl delete deployment hdtn-deployment
Use the get pods command to confirm they’ve been deleted:
microk8s kubectl get pods

19.0 TROUBLESHOOTING
By default HDTN is built in “Release mode”. To enable “Debug mode” during build use:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

19.1 Logging
Logging is controlled by CMake cache variables. Build (or rebuild) HDTN after making the following
changes under HDTN/build/CMakeCache.txt. By default logging to a file is turned off to reduce resource
draw.
- LOG_LEVEL_TYPE controls which messages are logged. The options, from most verbose to
least verbose, are TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, FATAL, and NONE. All log
statements using a level more verbose than the provided level will be compiled out of the
application. The default value is INFO.
- LOG_TO_CONSOLE controls whether log messages are sent to the console. The default value is
ON.
- LOG_TO_ERROR_FILE controls whether all error messages are written to a single error.log file.
The default value is OFF.
- LOG_TO_PROCESS_FILE controls whether each process writes to their own log file. The
default value is OFF.
- LOG_TO_SUBPROCESS_FILE controls whether each subprocess writes to their own log file.
The default value is OFF.

19.2 LTP Tuning Recommendations
There are several fields in the LTP configuration that will impact performance.
x Client service id corresponds to the LTP Client Service Identifiers as described in RFC7116. In
general, select 1 for compatibility with most DTN implementations. See
https://www.iana.org/assignments/ltp-parameters/ltp-parameters.xhtml. The following values are
common for the client service id.
– 0 - Reserved
– 1 - Bundle Protocol
– 2 - LTP Service Data Aggregation
– 3 - CCSDS File Delivery Service
x The following parameters must match on the sender and receiver:
– OneWayLightTimeMs
– OneWayMarginTimeMs
– LtpMaxRetriesPerSerialNumber
x To properly tune LTP for a system with appreciable delay, make sure 2 x (oneWayLightTimeMs +
oneWayMarginTimeMs) is slightly larger than the expected round trip time.
x Set ltpRandomNumberSizeBits to 32 for compatibility with DTNME. For HDTN to HDTN testing
use 64.
x Set ltpMaxRetriesPerSerialNumber to a larger number (around 100) on a system that has significant
disruptions. For a system that does not experience significant loss, 5 or less should be acceptable.

If LTP is being used on a lower-rate communication system that does not provide flow control (for
example a radio that supports several Mbps) it is important to set the LTP rate (either in the contact
plan or via --cla-rate) to slightly lower than the expected link rate. Failure to do so may cause
dropped packets since LTP is based on UDP. Alternatively, the max rate can be set per contact in the
contact plan by setting rateBitsPerSec to a nonzero value. If both fields are set, rateBitsPerSec in the
contact plan will take precedence.
For a particular outduct, the max data it can hold in its sending pipeline shall not exceed, whatever
comes first, either
– More bundles than maxNumberOfBundlesInPipeline
– More total bytes of bundles than maxSumOfBundleBytesInPipeline
An error is thrown on startup if (maxBundleSizeBytes * 2) is greater than
maxSumOfBundleBytesInPipeline.
Worst case RAM memory usage is given by summation of all outduct
maxSumOfBundleBytesInPipeline. The sum should not exceed the system memory.
If using Ethernet small frames, it is recommended to set the LTP MTU to 1360 to prevent IP
fragmentation.
Please see LtpEngineConfig.h docstrings for specific details related to LTP configuration.

20.0 NOTES
20.1 TLS Support for TCPCL Version 4
TLS Versions 1.2 and 1.3 are supported for the TCPCL Version 4 convergence layer. The X.509
certificates must be version 3 to validate IPN URIs using the X.509 “Subject Alternative Name” field.
HDTN must be compiled with ENABLE_OPENSSL_SUPPORT turned on in CMake. To generate (using
a single command) a certificate (which is installed on both an outduct and an induct) and a private key
(which is installed on an induct only), such that the induct has a Node Id of 10, use the following
command:
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout privatekey.pem -out
cert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -extensions v3_req -extensions v3_ca -subj
"/C=US/ST=Ohio/ L=Cleveland/O=NASA/OU=HDTN/CN=localhost" -addext
"subjectAltName = otherName:1.3.6.1.5.5.7.8.11;IA5:ipn:10.0" -config
/path/to/openssl.cnf
NOTE: RFC 9174 changed from the earlier -26 draft in that the Subject Alternative Name changed
from a URI to an otherName with ID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.8.11 (id-on-bundleEID).
x Therefore, do NOT use: -addext “subjectAltName = URI:ipn:10.0”
x Instead, use: -addext “subjectAltName = otherName:1.3.6.1.5.5.7.8.11;IA5:ipn:10.0”
To generate the Diffie-Hellman parameters PEM file (which is installed on an induct only), use the
following command:
openssl dhparam -outform PEM -out dh4096.pem 4096

20.2 BP Version 6 and Version 7
Both versions of BP, BP version 6 (BPv6) and BP version 7 (BPv7), are supported within the bpcodec
library.
